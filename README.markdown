### What is sign-ipa?

sign-ipa is a shell script with which you can sign an existing ipa using another provisioning profile, without having to build the application again. The Info.plist can be edited at the same time if needed.

For example, you can use this tool to:

* sign an application with several different provisioning profiles. This is for example useful if you sign your application both for ad-hoc and enterprise distribution
* update bundle information, e.g. the bundle version number. This is especially useful if you distribute your application using an integrated updater (e.g. Hockey Updater) which checks the version number against some (private) application store your company may provide. If all the changes are located in the Info.plist file or in the provisioning profile, you can therefore create a new version without having to rebuild the application, for the sole purpose of deploying it to your customers

### How should I use sign-ipa?

Simply save the sign-ipa.sh Bash script somewhere (ideally in your PATH) and give it execution permissions if needed (chmod +x sign-ipa.sh). Execute it with the -h parameter for help.
